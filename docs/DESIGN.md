# TIRED — Design

This document explains how the implementation works, stage by stage, and is honest about where the
lines are drawn. The guiding principle throughout the front-end is **no false positives**: a check only
fires when the type information needed to justify it is actually present.

## 1. Pipeline overview

```
source ──▶ lex ──▶ parse ──▶ check ──▶ lower ──▶ optimize ──▶ execute
            │        │         │         │          │            │
          tokens    AST     diagnostics  IR    waves + DRE   values / I/O
```

The first three stages (`tired-syntax`) and the next three (`tired-compiler`) are **zero-dependency,
std-only Rust**. Only execution (`tired-runtime`) uses third-party crates (`tokio`, `reqwest`,
`serde_json`).

---

## 2. Lexer (`tired-syntax/lexer.rs`)

A hand-written scanner producing a flat `Vec<Token>` terminated by `Eof`. Notable rules:

- **Duration literals** `5s`, `300ms`, `5min`, `2h` are recognised by reading the digits, then a
  trailing alphabetic run; if that run is a known unit it becomes a `Duration` (normalised to ms),
  otherwise the integer and the identifier are emitted separately.
- **`..` disambiguation**: a `.` is a decimal point only if followed by a digit, so `1..100` lexes as
  `Int(1) DotDot Int(100)`, never `1.` then `.100`.
- **`$NAME`** is an environment-variable token.
- **Strings** keep their *raw* inner text; interpolation is split later by the parser, which means the
  lexer needs no expression context.

Every token carries a byte-range `Span`, threaded through every later stage.

## 3. Parser (`tired-syntax/parser.rs`)

Recursive descent with a Pratt expression sub-parser for binary-operator precedence. Two details worth
calling out:

- **Struct-literal ambiguity.** `match scrut { … }` would parse `scrut {` as a record literal. A
  `no_record` flag (à la Rust) suppresses record detection while parsing a `match` scrutinee, and is
  reset inside `(...)`/`[...]`.
- **Contextual keywords.** Words like `retry` are keywords inside a `match` arm but ordinary names as an
  endpoint setting key. A "lenient name" helper accepts a keyword token as an identifier in the
  positions where only a name is grammatical.

On error the parser records a diagnostic and recovers to the next top-level item, so one typo doesn't
cascade.

## 4. Type system & checker (`tired-compiler/types.rs`, `check.rs`)

Types: `Int`, `Float`, `Bool`, `String`, `Null`, `Duration`, semantic scalars (`Url`, `Email`, …),
`Record(name)`, `Array`, `Optional`, and `Result<T, ErrDomain>` where the error domain is either
**open** (a single named error type → needs a catch-all) or a **closed set** of variants (a
`A | B` union → each must be handled). Inference is shallow: known annotations and declared records give
types; everything else is `Unknown`, which suppresses checks.

Three families of checks:

1. **Resolution** — `fetch` endpoints must be declared; an unknown one yields a "did you mean?" over the
   declared endpoints. Unknown lowercase identifiers used as a field receiver or a path parameter are
   reported similarly. (Upper-case names are treated as types/constructors and never flagged.)
2. **Field typing** — `x.field` on a known `Record` is validated against the record's fields; pipeline
   predicates (`filter(r => r.field)`, `sort(by: .field)`) are checked against the *element* type
   derived from the binding annotation. Wrong fields get a Levenshtein/optimal-string-alignment
   suggestion.
3. **Network-dependent error handling** (the flagship) —
   - a `Result`-typed binding must be `match`ed or `return`ed (propagated); otherwise it's an
     `unhandled error`;
   - reading a field off a `Result` is rejected ("match it first");
   - a `match` on a `Result` must be **exhaustive** over `Ok` and the error domain.

## 5. IR & lowering (`tired-compiler/ir.rs`, `lower.rs`)

Each body (the top-level script, a flow, a `match`-arm block) lowers to a `Body`: a flat `Vec<Node>`.
Expressions stay as their AST form — only *statements* become nodes. The key product of lowering is the
**dependency graph**:

- For each node we compute the set of free variables it **reads** (a structural walk that excludes
  lambda parameters and pattern bindings).
- A node depends on the most recent earlier node that **wrote** each variable it reads.
- **Effect** nodes (`log`, `return`, `assert`, flow calls, `match`) additionally chain to the previous
  effect, so observable order (e.g. log ordering) is preserved while pure computations stay free to
  reorder.

## 6. Optimizer (`tired-compiler/optimize.rs`)

Two passes over every body (recursing into `match` arms):

- **Dead-request elimination.** Liveness is backward reachability from the observable (effect) nodes.
  Anything unreached is dead; a dead *fetch* is reported (zero bytes will be sent) and excluded from the
  schedule.
- **Parallel inference.** Live nodes are levelled topologically: `level(n) = 1 + max(level of live
  deps)`. Nodes sharing a level form a **wave**. Because dependency edges always point to earlier ids, a
  single forward pass computes all levels. The waves are exactly the concurrency plan the runtime
  executes, and what `tired explain` prints.

## 7. Runtime (`tired-runtime`)

### Executor (`exec.rs`)
`run_body` walks the waves in order. For each wave it **spawns every fetch concurrently** on `tokio`
(each task gets an `Arc` to the shared state and an owned snapshot of the environment), awaits them, then
runs the wave's non-fetch nodes in program order. Because nodes in a wave are mutually independent, a
pre-wave environment snapshot is sufficient and there is no shared mutation during concurrency.

Control flow is handled here because it does I/O: a statement that calls a declared `flow` runs that flow
(recursively, boxed for async recursion); a `match` evaluates its scrutinee, picks an arm, and — for a
`retry` arm — runs the arm's effects (`wait`, side-effecting calls) and **re-runs the fetch that
produced the scrutinee**, capped at a fixed number of attempts.

### Backends
- **HTTP** (`http.rs`): a pooled `reqwest` client (HTTP/2 over rustls). Per request it applies the
  endpoint's timeout, bearer/API-key auth, and a TTL response cache, and retries `429`/`5xx`/network
  errors with constant or exponential backoff. Atomic counters expose request/cache-hit/retry/error
  totals (`--metrics`).
- **Mock** (`mock.rs`): a `mock` block becomes a routing table; a request is matched by method + path,
  parameters are captured and exposed to the response body as `$name`, and a response naming an error
  variant (`NotFound`, `RateLimit(ms)`, …) becomes a typed failure. This makes `tired test` fully
  offline and deterministic.
- **Contracts** (`contracts.rs`): when a fetch binding's record type carries `where (...)` constraints,
  the response is validated. Only declared constraints bite — extra/unknown fields are tolerated — so
  contracts catch real violations without being brittle against API evolution.

### Values (`value.rs`)
JSON plus durations and `Ok`/`Err`. A `Result`-annotated fetch wraps its outcome as `Ok(body)` /
`Err(variant)`; a plain fetch unwraps success and promotes a failure to a runtime error (with a hint to
annotate it as `Result<...>`).

---

## 8. Tooling

Three pieces of tooling reuse the core rather than re-implementing it.

- **Schema inference (`infer.rs`, `tired inspect`).** Given a JSON sample (a live URL or a file), it
  reconstructs TIRED `type` declarations: objects become typed records, arrays of objects become `Elem[]`
  with a *merged* element type (a field present in only some elements is marked nullable), and strings get
  semantic types (`Url`, `Email`, `DateTime`, `UUID`) by light heuristics. Pure and unit-tested.
- **Record & replay (`record.rs`, `--record` / `tired replay`).** In record mode every request's raw
  outcome is captured under a canonical key (`GET endpoint/path?sortedquery`) and written as JSON. In
  replay mode that file is served back *before* the network is touched — a missing key is a hard error, so
  a replay is fully deterministic and offline. This is "time-travel" debugging: reproduce exactly what an
  API returned without the live service.
- **Language server (`tired-lsp`, `tired lsp`).** A stdio LSP that runs `tired_compiler::analyze` on every
  edit and publishes the same diagnostics the CLI prints (byte spans mapped to UTF-16 LSP ranges), plus
  keyword/endpoint **completion** and **hover**. The message handler is pure and unit-tested; the loop only
  adds Content-Length framing. It depends only on the compiler + `serde_json`.

---

## 9. Deliberate limitations

These keep the implementation honest and focused on the language ideas:

- **Type-checker inference is annotation-driven.** Without a binding annotation a fetch result is
  `Unknown`, so field and exhaustiveness checks don't apply to it. Opting into `Result<...>` is how you opt
  into checked error handling. (`tired inspect` generates types offline from a sample, but the type checker
  itself does not infer response shapes from the network.)
- **`fetch` is GET.** The client surface models read APIs; the `server` side of the original spec
  (defining routes, generating OpenAPI/SDKs) and OpenAPI/GraphQL schema *import* are not built.
- **Pipelines build a per-element scope by cloning.** Fine for typical API payloads; a huge array with a
  large environment would want a cheaper scope representation.
- **Expression-position `match` is synchronous.** A `match` used as a value (`let x = match …`) cannot do
  fetches in its arms; lift it to a statement. Statement-level `match` is fully async.
- **The runtime is a scheduling tree-walker, not a bytecode VM/JIT.** The optimizer's data-dependency
  DAG is the real artefact; a bytecode backend and adaptive JIT are future work, not claimed here.
